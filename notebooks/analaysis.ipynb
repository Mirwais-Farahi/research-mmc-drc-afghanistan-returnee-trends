    "- A significantly higher proportion of males (96.27%) were interviewed without others hearing, compared to females (75.98%).\n",
    "- Conversely, nearly 1 in 4 females (24%) were not fully private during the interview.\n",

    "##### Recommendation:\n",
    "-Males are substantially more likely to be interviewed privately than females. This highlights a gender gap in interview privacy and suggests the need for improved privacy protocols for female respondents — such as choosing better locations or implementing stricter confidentiality practices during fieldwork."
